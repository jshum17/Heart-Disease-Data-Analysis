# Heart Disease Classification
DSCI 100 007 Group 5 Project Report: Justin Shum, Autumn Tricker, Dana Yamashiro
## Introduction 
Heart disease is a common health condition that affects many people around the world, with coronary disease being a significant contributor to its prevalence. Given the significant impact of coronary disease on public health, predictive analytics can help us gain a better understanding of the relationship between risk factors and disease development, ultimately guiding efforts to prevent and manage heart disease effectively.

## Data Analysis
In this report, we have created a K-NN classification model in R to perform a predictive analysis of heart disease based on a subset of a heart disease diagnosis database that contains information about 303 unique patients undergoing angiography at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio.

### Dataset
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

### Objective
How can we use diagnostic measurements such as age, maximum heart rate, and ST depression to classify whether a patitent has heart disease? (Presence = 1,2,3,4; Absence = 0)
